## General Information

### Background about case study
Programming assignment on Multiple Linear Regression Model concept

BOOM BIKES is a US based sharing provider, who is facing difficulty to sustain in the current market scenario of Corona Pandemic and dip in their revenue. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

### Business Goal:
Goal is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the BOOM BIKES management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

BOOM BIKES have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

#### The company wants to know:

    Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions

### Detailed Data Insights & Conclusions:

- Temperature is the Most Significant Feature which affects the Business positively,
- Whereas the other Environmental condition such as Raining, Humidity, Windspeed and Cloudy affects the Business negatively.
- Company need to think how to tackle with bad weather condition and come up with sort of solution which protect users from Raining.
- The Demand of Bikes is more in the Winter and Summer season, mostly user don't like to travel using Bikes in Rainy Day or Rainy Season.
- It is interesting to see Specially Saturday People like to Rent a Bike more than other usual Days

- Even though without expending a single cent BOOM Bikes can expect their business to grow by 19%
